### Rendering Strategies
- **SSR:** Server-Side Rendering, allows your pages to be rendered on the server before sending them to the client. This can improve performance and SEO.
- **SSG:** Static Site Generation, where pages are pre-rendered at build time, resulting in faster loading for static content.
- **ISR:** Incremental Static Regeneration, allows you to update static pages without rebuilding the entire site.
- **CSR:** Client-Side Rendering, allows you to fetch data on the client-side and render pages dynamically.
